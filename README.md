# linkshortner
This code uses the pyshorteners library to shorten a given link using the TinyURL shortener. The code starts by importing the pyshorteners module. Then it prompts the user to enter a link, which is saved to the variable 'link'. The 'pyshorteners.Shortener()' function is used to create a Shortener object, which is stored in the variable 'shortener'. The code then calls the 'short' method of the 'tinyurl' attribute of the 'shortener' object, passing in the 'link' variable as an argument. The shortened link is then stored in the variable 'x' and printed to the console.
